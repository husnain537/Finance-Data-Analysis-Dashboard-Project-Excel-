# Finance-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Project-Excel-
I completed a real-world finance data project focused on customer behavior and performance metrics. This end-to-end project helped me strengthen my data cleaning, analysis, and dashboarding skills using Microsoft Excel.
Built an interactive Excel dashboard to showcase insights clearly, enabling any stakeholder to filter and explore the data with ease. The visuals are clean, impactful, and user-friendly.
